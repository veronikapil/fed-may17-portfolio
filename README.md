# Portfolio Sample

A simple example of a portfolio.

## To Do:

- When the page scrolls, slide the logo up at half the logo up at half the rate
- When the page has fully scrolled, hide the logo, show the top bar
- When the screen goes over 768px, note the tiling issue with the image - solve that with the 'masonry' plugin
  - Why is this happened anyways?!
- A few plugins to try:
  - Sweet alert
  - In view
  - Fluid box
  - Load more images
- Clean up all the code so that it runs only when the page is ready
